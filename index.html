        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h4>Who We Are:</h4>
        <p>Hey there! We're MAD-K, a small team with a big love for stickers. What started as a simple passion for doodling and arts and crafts, soon turned into something bigger; a way to share our designs with others who love adding a bit of color to their everyday lives!</p>
        <h4>How It All Started:</h4>
        <p>Like many artists, we were always working on projects and DIY gifts. We also loved stickers. From collecting sticker, to decorating everything we owned with them! But we realised something was missing. Stickers that felt truly unique and personal. That's when we decided to create MAD-K. A place where anyone can find stickers that match their style, whether from our hand-crafted sticker sets, to custom made bundles tailored just for them!</p>
        <h4>What We Do:</h4>
        <p><strong>Sticker Sets:</strong> We design and create themed packs, featuring everything from animals, to letters and numbers! Perfect for journaling decorating or just collecting!</p>
        <p><strong>Custom Sticker Bundles:</strong> We take commissions to create sticker sets based on what you want! You dream it, we design it!</p>
        <h4>Why We Love This:</h4>
        <p>For us, stickers are more than just decorations. They're little pieces of self-expression, creativity, and joy! Whether it's a sticker that makes you smile, or just adds a pop of excitement to your day, we love being a part of that.</p>
        <p>So welcome to MAD-K, where stickers aren't just stickers, they're stories waiting to happen and be shared.</p>
        <h4>Have Questions?</h4>
        <p>Feel free to contact us anytime! We're always happy to answer questions or get feedback from customers!</p>
